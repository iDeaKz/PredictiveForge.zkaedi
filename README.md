Example
python
Copy code
from predictiveforge import adaptive_parallel, polymorphic_compute, logistic_regression_predict

# Example data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Adaptive Parallel Processing
parallel_result = adaptive_parallel(data)
print("Parallel Result:", parallel_result)

# Polymorphic Compute
poly_result = polymorphic_compute(data)
print("Polymorphic Compute Result:", poly_result)
Core Components
adaptive_parallel(data: List[int])
Efficiently scales processing based on CPU load, ideal for high-frequency data computations.

polymorphic_compute(data: Union[List[int], Dict[Any, int], np.ndarray])
Caches frequently used operations for diverse data types to improve speed and reduce memory usage.

logistic_regression_predict(X_train: np.ndarray, y_train: np.ndarray, X_test: np.ndarray)
A simple logistic regression model to make binary predictions on new data.

recursive_matrix_multiply(A: np.ndarray, B: np.ndarray)
Handles matrix multiplication with recursive, fractal-inspired subdivision.

chi_square_test(observed: np.ndarray)
Performs a Chi-square test for independence on a contingency table.

Example Applications
Predictive Trading Model
Leverage logistic regression with time-series data to predict trading opportunities.

Real-Time IoT Monitoring
Use adaptive parallel processing and async I/O to monitor high-frequency IoT data.

Anomaly Detection in Big Data
Identify outliers in large datasets with statistical testing and spatial analysis using Convex Hull.

Live Data Dashboard
Integrate async operations and adaptive processing to build a live analytics dashboard.
